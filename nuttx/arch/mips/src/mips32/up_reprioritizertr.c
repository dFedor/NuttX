 * Name: up_reprioritize_rtr
 *
 * Description:
 *   Called when the priority of a running or
 *   ready-to-run task changes and the reprioritization will
 *   cause a context switch.  Two cases:
 *
 *   1) The priority of the currently running task drops and the next
 *      task in the ready to run list has priority.
 *   2) An idle, ready to run task's priority has been raised above the
 *      the priority of the current, running task and it now has the
 *      priority.
 *
 * Inputs:
 *   tcb: The TCB of the task that has been reprioritized
 *   priority: The new task priority
 *
